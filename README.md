![screenshot-localhost_8888-2025 03 31-11_49_10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac1ff8f-45a1-40f7-9731-80f424285a13)

### Overview

This project analyzes the behavior of gold prices during major financial crises to assess its role as a safe-haven asset. Using historical price data from 1993 to 2022, I examined gold’s performance across different timeframes (daily, monthly, and quarterly) and evaluated key financial metrics such as returns, volatility, and drawdowns. 

### Key Objectives

- Investigate gold price trends during financial crises.
- Evaluate gold’s performance as a safe-haven asset based on returns, volatility, and drawdowns.
- Compare normal vs. crisis volatility and assess risk.

### Dataset

The dataset includes historical gold price data (in USD) along with other currency values, covering various financial crises:

- Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998)
- Dot-com Bubble (2000-2002)
- Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009)
- European Debt Crisis (2010-2012)
- COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)
- 2022 Inflation Crisis

### Project Workflow

1. Preprocessing Data
2. Safe Haven Analysis
3. Visualization

### Key Findings

- Gold had positive returns in 4 out of 6 crises (67%), reinforcing its reputation as a hedge.
- Volatility increased in 4 out of 6 crises, indicating higher price fluctuations during economic instability.

### Future Work

1. Incorporate macroeconomic indicators (inflation, interest rates, stock market trends).
2. Use sentiment analysis on news data to predict gold price movements.
